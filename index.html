        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>This report is part of  the Telfer School of Management&#x27;s Innovations in Education Series. It presents a synthesis of the findings, reflections and recommendations resulting from three co-construction workshops bringing together professors, students and pedagogical advisors around the same objective: to adapt the pedagogy of the B.Com in order to strengthen its coherence, participation and alignment with the needs of a changing world.</p>
<p>The exercise was not aimed at a simple reform of content, but at a cultural and institutional transformation. The discussions highlighted several converging challenges: the need for more collaborative academic governance, the need to support faculty pedagogical training, the redefinition of the classroom relationship, the coherence of the student pathway, as well as the ethical framework for the use of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Based on these observations, we formulate ten recommendations structured in five areas :</p>
<p>Axis 1: Innovation governance</p>
<p>Axis 2: Support for faculty</p>
<p>Axis 3: Pedagogical relationship</p>
<p>Axis 4: Student experience</p>
<p>Axis 5: Artificial intelligence</p>
<p>These orientations reflect a common desire: to make the Telfer B.Com a training model that balances academic excellence, pedagogical innovation and educational humanism.</p>
<p>Beyond reforms, this report proposes a sustainable vision: that of a school where teaching, learning and collaboration become shared acts, driven by trust, responsibility and creativity. The renewed B.Com aims to train managers capable not only of performing, but also of thinking and acting meaningfully in a changing world.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The revision of the Telfer School of Management&#x27;s Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com) program is part of a collective process of pedagogical transformation initiated as part of the Telfer Innovations in Education Series.</p>
<p>The objective was not to produce a technical or curricular reform, but to push the boundaries of pedagogy by rethinking the way of teaching, learning and collaborating. This initiative, supported by the faculty&#x27;s management, brought together professors, students, academic advisors and staff members in the same space for reflection and co-construction.</p>
<p>The first year of the B.Com served as a starting point, perceived as a founding moment where students&#x27; reference points, motivation and sense of belonging are forged. The discussions revealed a shared observation: beyond the content and methods, it is the pedagogical relationship between professors, students and institutions that determines the quality of the learning experience.</p>
<p>The workshops made it possible to name these issues, to understand their causes and to imagine realistic solutions, anchored in everyday academic life.</p>
<p>This reflection was based on three ambitions:</p>
<p>Restore the coherence of the training path and give a clear meaning to each stage of the program.</p>
<p>To strengthen trust and collaboration between actors, by promoting continuous and constructive dialogue.</p>
<p>Foster a culture of innovation and responsibility, particularly in the use of technology and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The three successive workshops thus constituted a laboratory of living ideas, where the diversity of voices; those of professors, students and advisors, made it possible to identify specific findings and applicable recommendations.</p>
<p>Each exchange contributed to the emergence of a common vision: that of a school where pedagogy becomes a lever for meaning, coherence and humanism.</p>
<p>This report presents a synthesis of this work and proposes structuring recommendations to guide the transformation of the B.Com.</p>
<p>It reflects the very spirit of Telfer: an institution that looks to the future, is committed to excellence, and believes that quality education is born of dialogue, trust and the courage to innovate together.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The work carried out through the workshops was not intended to correct a curriculum, but to reinvent the way we teach, learn and collaborate.</p>
<p>The transformation of the B.Com is based on a clear ambition: to train minds capable of discernment, rigour and openness, in a world where information is abundant but meaning is scarce. She recognizes that the quality of an education is not measured solely by the transmission of knowledge, but by an institution&#x27;s ability to cultivate curiosity, critical thinking and intellectual ethics.</p>
<p>The teachers expressed their desire to give meaning to their teaching, to create spaces for dialogue and to nurture critical thinking. The students, for their part, have shown a desire to learn differently, to understand the why behind the how, and to actively participate in the evolution of the program.</p>
<p>By bringing these two voices together, Telfer is reconnecting with its primary vocation: to make knowledge a living, shared and demanding experience.</p>
<p>Reinventing the first year of the B.Com means giving coherence and breath to the course. It means making technology a tool for discernment, not ease, and integrity a collective strength, not a constraint. It is to affirm that pedagogical modernity is not based on rupture, but on a renewed alliance between teachers and students, united by the search for meaning and the passion for learning.</p>
<p>This reform commits each member of the community to contribute to a culture of trust, listening and shared excellence. It calls for a pedagogy of courage, where innovation is aligned with the values of responsibility and intellectual rigour, and where success becomes a common work.</p>
<p>The Telfer School of Management is thus positioned as a clear-sighted and committed institution, which does not undergo change but shapes it. By training managers capable of understanding, questioning and acting responsibly, it fulfills the promise of the renewed B.Com:</p>
<p>learn to think about the world in order to better transform it.</p>
